***** TO DO *****
- string concatenation with ++ : added to absyn, parser and operators
- intToString : added to stdlib
- boolToString : added to stdlib
- check on functions return type
- create new test examples (simple.java), in order to check that functions run correctly
- add "import" statement evaluation, in order to import libraries
- choose between complex obfuscation and confidentiality values (i.e. with double values we have a more extensible solution), and simple ones (using enumeration, with only LOW, MEd, HIGH values, like in the lattices of the paper)
- is it correct to pass to Statement another label?
